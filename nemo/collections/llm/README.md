NeMo LLM Collection
===================

The NeMo LLM Collection is the first collection that features NeMo 2.0, a redesign of NeMo that
aims to improve the user experience in by taking a more PyTorch Lightning-like approach to make
NeMo both simpler and more modular. 

The current models are currently reimplemented in 2.0 as part of this collection:
- **GPT**
- **LLaMA**
- **Mixtral**

For detailed tutorials and documentation of NeMo 2, please refer to the NeMo 2.0 [docs](../../../docs/source/2.0) (## TODO: update this hyperlink).
